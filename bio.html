	<h2>Who is Tristan McTigue?</h2>
		<p>I was born in Columbia, South Carolina on February 6, 2020. I moved to Maryland in 2006 and lived there untill 2014 when I moved back to South Carolina. I've been attending St. Joseph's Catholic School ever since the 6th grade, and I am currently a senior in High School. For college, I am considering going to Clemson University, but that decision is not final. As for my familly, I have 3 brothers and 1 sister. I have a twin brother, and we are both the youngest in the family. There 4 years in between me and the oldest sibling, which is my sister.</p>
	<h2>Where Will I Be In 5 Years?</h2>
		<p>For my college major, I am considering doing something in computers or medicine. In 5 years, I will finish my undergraduate studies and move on to graduate school. By that point, I will be 22 years old, and the year will be 2025.</p>
	<h2>Where Will I Be In 10 Years?</h2>
		<p>In 10 years, I might be working with computers at my job, which would involve coding. If I pursue a medical degree, then I could still be at school in 10 years. I could potentially be married, and I might even have a kid. I will probably own both a house and a car. I will be 27 years old, and the year will be 2030.</p>
